# Contributing to Wool Witch

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Wool Witch! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## 🌟 Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js (>= 18.0.0)
- npm or yarn
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (for local database)
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) (install with `npm install -g supabase`)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) (recommended)
- Git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wool-witch.git
cd wool-witch
```

3. **Add upstream remote:**
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/dataGrif/wool-witch.git
```

4. **Set up the project:**
```bash
task setup  # Installs dependencies and creates .env.local
```

5. **Start local development (no cloud account needed):**
```bash
task dev:local  # Starts local Supabase + dev server
```

This will:
- Start Supabase locally with Docker (first time takes a few minutes)
- Apply database migrations automatically
- Start the Vite development server
- Open the app at http://localhost:5173

### Accessing Development Tools

When running locally:
- 🌐 **Web App**: http://localhost:5173
- 📊 **Supabase Studio** (DB Admin): http://localhost:54323
- 🔌 **API**: http://localhost:54321
- 📧 **Email Testing**: http://localhost:54324

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests

### Making Changes

1. **Make your changes** in small, logical commits
2. **Run quality checks** frequently:
```bash
task test  # Runs lint and typecheck
# or
npm run lint && npm run typecheck
```

3. **Test your changes** locally:
```bash
task dev:local  # Start dev server with local database
task build      # Ensure it builds successfully
```

### Code Style

We use ESLint and TypeScript for code quality:

- **Run linter:**
```bash
task lint  # or npm run lint
```

- **Auto-fix issues:**
```bash
task lint:fix  # or npm run lint -- --fix
```

- **Type checking:**
```bash
task typecheck  # or npm run typecheck
```

### Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally

Examples:
```
Add shopping cart persistence feature

Fix layout issue on mobile devices

Update README with installation instructions

Refactor product card component for better reusability
```

## 📝 Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest upstream changes:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

2. **Ensure all checks pass:**
```bash
task test
task build
```

3. **Push to your fork:**
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

4. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - List of changes made

5. **Respond to review feedback** promptly

### Pull Request Checklist
